# The Java Object-Oriented Approach

Use abstract classes when you want to 
- Offer some base functionality to subclasses
- Provide a template for future classes
- Create abstract members that are not public

Use interfaces
- Highest level of abstraction
- Highest level of loose coupling
- Implement more interfaces
